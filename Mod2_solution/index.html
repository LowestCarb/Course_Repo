            <p>"Where did you get that?" I say. Billy just looks at me and says, "Found it." 
                <br>
                "Well, where? How long have you had that?"
                <br>
                "I just picked it up, it's fresh!"
                <br>
                "Fresh from where?"
                <br>
                "Silly goose, it's just pizza. Eat it! You said you were hungry."
                "I know, but you just pulled that out of thin air! We're literally standing at a cross walk."
                "It's still warm, do you want it or no?"
                "I mean, I'll take it... I only have granola bars on me."
                "You're always so skeptical, lighten up!"
                The sun all of a sudden gets a little brighter as the cloud cover moves away. That was weird, I thought to myself.
                We keep walking while I enjoy my pineapple pizza slice.
                "Boy, I could use something to wash that down"
                "Here you go!" Billy says, handing me a paper cup filled with life blood, Dr. Pepper.
                "Oh you're a life saver!" I say, not thinking about it. As I finish my cup of the nectar of the gods I realize we hadn't packed any paper cups for our trip up town. "Wait a minute... where did that come from?"
                "What do you mean?"
                "I just... you know what? nevermind, let's just get there and get this over with."
                We finally arrive, the family is already gathered in the seating area.
                The sign at the front of the event reads, "Billy Bacilli, may he rest forever in our hearts."</p>
