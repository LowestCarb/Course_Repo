                "Where did you get that?" I say. Billy just looks at me and says, "Found it." 
                <br>
                "Well, where? How long have you had that?"
                <br>
                "I just picked it up, it's fresh!"
                <br>
                "Fresh from where?"
                <br>
                "Silly goose, it's just pizza. Eat it! You said you were hungry."
                <br>
                "I know, but you just pulled that out of thin air! We're literally standing at a cross walk."
                <br>
                "It's still warm, do you want it or no?"
                <br>
                "I mean, I'll take it... I only have granola bars on me."
                <br>
                "You're always so skeptical, lighten up!"
                <br>
                The sun all of a sudden gets a little brighter as the cloud cover moves away. That was weird, I thought to myself.
                <br>
                We keep walking while I enjoy my pineapple pizza slice.
                <br>
                "Boy, I could use something to wash that down"
                <br>
                "Here you go!" Billy says, handing me a paper cup filled with life blood, Dr. Pepper.
                <br>
                "Oh you're a life saver!" I say, not thinking about it. As I finish my cup of the nectar of the gods I realize we hadn't packed any paper cups for our trip up town. "Wait a minute... where did that come from?"
                <br>
                "What do you mean?"
                <br>
                "I just... you know what? nevermind, let's just get there and get this over with."
                <br>
                We finally arrive, the family is already gathered in the seating area.
                <br>
                The sign at the front of the event reads, "Billy Bacilli, may he rest forever in our hearts."
