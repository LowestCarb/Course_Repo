          <p>"Where did you get that?" I say. Billy just looks at me and says, "Found it." 
            <br>"Well, where? How long have you had that?"
            <br>"I just picked it up, it's fresh!"
            <br>"Fresh from where?"
            <br>"Silly goose, it's just pizza. Eat it! You said you were hungry."
            <br>"I know, but you just pulled that out of thin air! We're literally standing at a cross walk."
            <br>"It's still warm, do you want it or no?"
            <br>"I mean, I'll take it... I only have granola bars on me."
            <br>"You're always so skeptical, lighten up!"
            <br>The sun all of a sudden gets a little brighter as the cloud cover moves away. That was weird, I thought to myself.
            <br>We keep walking while I enjoy my pineapple pizza slice.
            <br>"Boy, I could use something to wash that down"
            <br>"Here you go!" Billy says, handing me a paper cup filled with life blood, Dr. Pepper.
            <br>"Oh you're a life saver!" I say, not thinking about it. As I finish my cup of the nectar of the gods I realize we hadn't packed any paper cups for our trip up town. "Wait a minute... where did that come from?"
            <br>"What do you mean?"
            <br>"I just... you know what? nevermind, let's just get there and get this over with."
            <br>We finally arrive, the family is already gathered in the seating area.
            <br>The sign at the front of the event reads, "Billy Bacilli, may he rest forever in our hearts."
